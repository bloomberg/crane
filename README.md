## Rationale

This project provides extraction of [Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/) (formerly known as Coq) code to (optionally [BDE](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde)-flavored) C++ code, implemented as a Rocq plugin. It extracts Rocq into valid, performant, and memory-safe, modern C++ code. The generated code avoids tracing garbage collection and does not need a separate runtime system, relying instead on `std::shared_ptr` or `bsl::shared_ptr` for reference counting.

The project is a fork of the Rocq-to-OCaml extraction that comes built-in with Rocq.

> [!WARNING]  
> Crane is under active development. While many features are functional, parts of the extraction pipeline are still experimental, and you may encounter incomplete features or unexpected behavior. Please report issues on the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/bloomberg/crane/issues).

## Examples

A curated selection of C++ files generated by Crane (accompanied with their source Rocq programs) is available to view in the `tests` directory. The tests are organized thematically, with `tests/basics` containing traditional, functional Rocq progams, and `tests/monadic` containing effectful examples.

## Installation

Once you clone the repo, if you have [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) and [dune](https://dune.build/), you can run

```bash
opam install . --deps-only
```

To install OCaml (at least 4.14.0) and Rocq (at least 9.0.0). You can then build and install the project by running

```bash
dune build -p rocq-crane && dune install
```

You will also need [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) 19 or higher to run the tests, and [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for standard formatting.

To preview the project easily and quickly, you can run `dune build` to run the tests and see if the plugin is working properly on your machine, and find the generated files (such as `list.cpp` for `List.v`) in the `tests` directory. **Currently not all tests in the directory are expected to pass (and thus some failing does not mean the plugin is installed incorrectly)**.

To run the `Crane Benchmark` command, you will need to have [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) installed.

## Usage

Once you write your Rocq program, you can extract to C++:

```coq
Module Foo.

Fixpoint fac n :=
  match n with
  | 0 | 1 => 1
  | S n' => n * fac n'
  end.

End Foo.

Require Crane.Extraction.
Require Crane.Mapping.Std.
Crane Extraction "Foo" Foo.
```

(You can also extract a single function if you do not want to extract an entire module, which will just extract the function with all of its dependencies as opposed to this which extracts all the definitions in the module [and their dependencies].)

Now run:

```bash
rocq compile Foo.v && clang++ -c -std=c++23 Foo.cpp -o Foo.o
```

This command creates `Foo.h` and `Foo.cpp` files from the Rocq file, and the compiles the C++ to the object file `Foo.o` with Clang, ready to be linked to your own C++ file containing a `main` function for execution.
